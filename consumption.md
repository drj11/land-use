# Consumption

The rather splendid
Readers Digest Atlas of The World
has handy and pleasingly unambiguous figures
for the average UK diet.

The atlas is ancient, so the figures are in ounces.
I've converted them to grammes.

food | oz/day | g/day
Cereals | 11.1 | 315
Potatoes | 7.5 | 213
Sugar and Preserves | 3.5 | 99
Vegetables | 5.5 | 156
Fruits | 5.4 | 153
Meat and Fish | 7.4 | 210
Eggs | 1.4 | 40
Milk and Milk products | 15.6 | 442
Fats | 2.0 | 57

I expect all of these figures are higher now,
but given the levels of obesity in the UK,
maybe we should collectively be consuming a little bit less
[FAO2013].
In the absence of any of other references,
I'll use the values tabulated here.
