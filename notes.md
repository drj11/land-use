# Tea

1650 kg per hectare (best) [Tea1]. Wet or dry?

+ pesticides

Consumption (me, drj): 250g in 15 days (3 weeks to go through a
100 box of Taylors Earl Grey).

6 kg tea per year.

37 m²


# Apples

Apple1: http://www.goodfruit.com/calculate-target-yield/ on 2016-05-11

65000 kg per hectare (best) [Apple1]

An apple a day = 60 kg per year

9.2 m²


# Plastics

Bioplastic1: "Agricultural Resources for Bioplastics", bioplastics MAGAZINE [06/11] Vol. 6

We should assume a sustainable source for all input materials.
Thus, the land use of plastic should be based on
how much land we need to grow
oil crops that can be converted to plastic.

There will be some recycling.
There may be some use of byproduct.

Sankey diagram.

There is a whole wikipedia article on bioplastic which starts
with how bioplastics should be called biobased polymer.

If you've eaten with a biodegradable plastic fork, probably a
bioplastic.

Yield: 2500 kg per hectare [Bioplastic1]. 4 m² per kg.

50kg plastic per person per year?

200m² = 0.8 allotments

# Paper

[paper2]

Europe 120kg per person per year (_much_ higher in the USA)
[paper1]

1000 kg paper requires 17 trees (average) [paper1]

m² per tree is controversial [paper2]. 600 trees per acre may be
typical (wide range). 1400 per hectare.

Complicated by the fact that the same tree might make both pulp
(for paper and other products like OSB) and sawn timber (and
glue, from lignin).
And, by selecting species and growing conditions,
a trade-off between paper and other wood products is possible.

6.7m² per tree
14m² per person
0.06 allotments
