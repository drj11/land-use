# Plastics

Bioplastic1: "Agricultural Resources for Bioplastics", bioplastics MAGAZINE [06/11] Vol. 6

We should assume a sustainable source for all input materials.
Thus, the land use of plastic should be based on
how much land we need to grow
oil crops that can be converted to plastic.

There will be some recycling.
There may be some use of byproduct.

Sankey diagram.

There is a whole wikipedia article on bioplastic which starts
with how bioplastics should be called biobased polymer.

If you've eaten with a biodegradable plastic fork, probably a
bioplastic.

# Paper

Europe 120kg per person per year (_much_ higher in the USA)
[paper1]

1000 kg paper requires 17 trees (average) [paper1]

m² per tree is controversial [paper2]. 600 trees per acre may be
typical (wide range). 1400 per hectare.

Complicated by the fact that the same tree might make both pulp
(for paper and other products like OSB) and sawn timber (and
glue, from lignin).
And, by selecting species and growing conditions,
a trade-off between paper and other wood products is possible.

# Biofuels

Obviously this is part of a much larger energy section, but...

[Biomass1]
http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,163231&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL
on 2016-05-13 (good luck with that URL!)

[SEWTHA]
"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air"

Energy crop yield is 11 to 63 MWh/ha per year.
Let's say 50 MWh/ha.

biofuel:production,50MWh,hectare


[SEWTHA] has a figure of 195kWh per person per day.

biofuel:consumption,71Mwh,year

biofuel:land,57allot

This figure remember, assumes we're making all of our energy from a
reasonably efficient biological source.
Recall that our "budget" was about 15 allotments;
so we've blown it.

# Solar

10W/m² averaged over a year (MacKay).
100kWh/m²

10m² per MWh.

About 3 allotments.

Why do we even bother with biofuels?
One answer is that we're going to need _some_ biofuels.
For example, liquid fuels for aviation.

# Soybean

[soybean1]

on 2016-05-16

[bushel1]
https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/scales/bushels.html on 2016-05-16

Yield might be 50 bushels per acre [soybean1] but exceptionally,
100. 3000 lbs per acre [bushel1].

3360 kg per hectare.
3m² per kg.

How much milk does that make?

Alpro Soya Milk seems to be 6.5% soya bean.

So 0.5 litres of milk a day is about 200 litres of milk a year.
Which is (× 0.065) 13 kg bean per year.

So, if we drink soy milk, we need about 40m², or 2 square rods
(one fifth of an allotment).

# Eggs

Why did the frenchman have only one egg for breakfast?

Because one egg is un oeuf.

According to wikipedia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs#European_Union]
EU regs require that a free range hen has 4m² space.
That hen will, if replaced on a regular basis,
produce one egg per day.

So for our frenchman's daily egg consumption we require only 4m².

Except that we forgot to feed the hen.
100g per day
http://www.poultryhub.org/nutrition/nutrient-requirements/nutrient-requirements-of-egg-laying-chickens/
36.5 kg per year.

Assuming we feed them soybean,
that's about 110m² of land to
grow the soybean to feed to the chickens.

Whatever the numbers it's clear that feeding the hens takes far
more land than accommodating them.

About ½ allotment.

Of course, given half an allotment of land growing a crop, one
coule simply keep the hen on that.
You can't really save much land this way,
because that land still has to be capable of
growing enough food to feed the hen.
It doesn't matter whether you harvest and process the food first,
or whether the hen eats it directly off the land.

# Oats

_Avena sativa_

[oat1] Product description for "Oatly Healthy Organic Oat Drink 1L"

[crop0815] http://www.usda.gov/nass/PUBS/TODAYRPT/crop0815.pdf

[oat2014] http://www.producer.com/daily/eu-oat-exports-set-for-nine-year-high-on-north-america-woes/

Oat yield varies between 36 and 100 bushels per acre [crop0815].
A bushel of oats is 32 lb (according to wikipedia).
Which is between 1290 and 3590 kg per hectare.
Yields in Europe are much higher [eurostat].
Between 1200 (Portugal) and 8440 kg per hectare
(Republic of Ireland).
With several nation states cropping above 5000 kg per hectare.

The reference above nicely illustrates the relationship between
yield and area harvested.
The more land you put into production the lower the yield.
As you try and find more land to plant,
the land becomes harder to find and less suitable.
The amount of land that is truly excellent for
growing oats at high yield is very small.

Assuming a reasonably good, but not close to best,
yield of 4000 kg per hectare,
we have 2.5m² per kg.

Oats:production,4000kg,hectare,good,[eurostat]

Oat milk is about 10% oats [oat1].
0.5 litre per day is about 200 litre per year per person.
about 20 kg of oats (in the form of milk) per person per year.

So 50 m² of oats per person per year.
Two square rods.

For breakfast I eat porridge made with
30 g of oats, 150 ml of water,
and cooked in the microwave for 2 minutes.

This is 11 kg per year.
Which is 28 m² or about 1 square rod.

Incidentally, this is close to what the UK produces [eurostat].
The same story applies to the broader EU region.
Total production is about 50g per person per day,
so it is entirely plausible that the EU, collectively,
eats all of most of the oats it produces.

There are some exports (almost no imports),
but they are generally very small.
Even in record export years,
caused by the Canadian train network being overwhelmed [oat2014],
total EU exports amount to a couple of percent.

Can we use oat straw for heat / thermal power stations?
Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat#Yield_and_quality
suggests straw yield between 1000 kg and 3000 kg per hectare.
5m² per kg.

Converting at 16 MJ/kg gives 32 GJ/hectare or
about 9 MWh/hectare.
Note that is a lot less (about one fifth) of
dedicated biofuel production,
but then we are getting it "for free",
as a by-product of food production.
It's free in terms of land use anyhow.

# Maize

_Zea mays_

[HC180] Soil Health, Environmental Audit Committee, 2016-05-25

Reported in paragraph 70 of [HC180]: 186000 hectares maize.
0.12 allotments each.

# Milk (Cow's Milk)

[Milk2016] House of Commons Briefing Paper Number 2721, 20 January 2016

From Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle#Dairy
average output is 22 litres per cow per day.

Which is also very close to the average for the UK (21 litres
per day [Milk2016).

Not all produced milk is consumed by humans, some is wasted,
some re-enters the animal food chain.

Consumption by type is roughly [Milk2016]:
50% Liquid consumption
28% Cheese
11% Milk powder
5% Other manufacture
6% Butter, Cream, Condensed milk

There is little international trade (3% export; 1% import).

So per UK resident:
14.6 billion litres divided by 70 million people:

~ 200 litres per person per year

or about 0.6 litres per person per day.

(see also Soybean)

(Seems quite difficult to get numbers on amount of land these
cows might require).

# Bamboo

A random webpage
http://madeinusachallenge.com/2012/help-grow-the-bamboo-industry-in-the-usa/
report that bamboo in a 3 year cycle yields 20 m tons (metric
tonnes?) per acre (ugh).
Which is

4.9 kg per m²

# Potato

Potato:consumption,78kg,year

Potato:production,40000kg,hectare,typical,[eurostat]

100 kg per square rod.

So we need a little bit less than 1 square rod.

# Cereals

[AHDBCEREAL]
https://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/media/658213/hgca-cereal-a5-16pp-final.pdf

[AHDBFORAGE]
http://beefandlamb.ahdb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BRP-Home-grown-forages-directory-181214.pdf

[FARMSTAT2015]
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/486326/structure-jun2015final-uk-17dec15.pdf

In the UK, cereal crops are Wheat, Barley, Oats, and Rape.
Wheat is grown for human and animal feed;
Barley is grown for human and animal feed (and brewing!).
Oats grown for human and animal feed;
Rape is grown for human feed (as oil),
animal feed (as oil and cake), and fuel oil (for heating and
biodiesel). [AHDB]

Yields are (roughly):

crop|yield, tonnes/hectare
Wheat|8.0
Barley|6.0
Oats|6.0
Rape|3.5

At least according to [AHDBFORAGE]
these all have similar calorific values at 12 to 14 MJ/kg
(metabolic energy, dry matter)

Adult human calorific requirements are 8.4MJ to 10.5MJ per day.

We get all our calories from cereals.
If we did that, it would be
750g cereal / day.
270kg per year.

We can grow all of our cereal on
1.4 to 1.8 allotments,
depending on cereal mix,
and assuming best practice yield.

It seems unlikely we could eat such a diet,
but it is nice to know that we can cover our calorific requirements
with a couple of allotments.
