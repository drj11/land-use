Consumption (me, drj): 250g in 15 days (3 weeks to go through a
100 box of Taylors Earl Grey).

6 kg tea per year.

# Plastics

Bioplastic1: "Agricultural Resources for Bioplastics", bioplastics MAGAZINE [06/11] Vol. 6

We should assume a sustainable source for all input materials.
Thus, the land use of plastic should be based on
how much land we need to grow
oil crops that can be converted to plastic.

There will be some recycling.
There may be some use of byproduct.

Sankey diagram.

There is a whole wikipedia article on bioplastic which starts
with how bioplastics should be called biobased polymer.

If you've eaten with a biodegradable plastic fork, probably a
bioplastic.

Yield: 2500 kg per hectare [Bioplastic1]. 4 m² per kg.

50kg plastic per person per year?

200m² = 0.8 allotments

# Paper

[paper1]

[paper2]
http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs141p2_021966.pdf

Europe 120kg per person per year (_much_ higher in the USA)
[paper1]

1000 kg paper requires 17 trees (average) [paper1]

m² per tree is controversial [paper2]. 600 trees per acre may be
typical (wide range). 1400 per hectare.

Complicated by the fact that the same tree might make both pulp
(for paper and other products like OSB) and sawn timber (and
glue, from lignin).
And, by selecting species and growing conditions,
a trade-off between paper and other wood products is possible.

6.7m² per tree
14m² per person
0.06 allotments

# Biofuels

Obviously this is part of a much larger energy section, but...

[Biomass1]
http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,163231&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL
on 2016-05-13 (good luck with that URL!)

Energy crop yield is 11 to 63 MWh/ha per year.
Let's say 50 MWh/ha.

200m² per MWh.
0.8 allotments per MWh.

MacKay has a figure of 195kWh per person per day,
which is 71 MWh per year.

57 allotments.

This figure remember, assumes we're making all of our energy from a
reasonably efficient biological source.
Recall that our "budget" was about 15 allotments;
so we've blown it.

# Solar

10W/m² averaged over a year (MacKay).
100kWh/m²

10m² per MWh.

About 3 allotments.

Why do we even bother with biofuels?
One answer is that we're going to need _some_ biofuels.
For example, liquid fuels for aviation.

# Soybean

[soybean1]
http://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2014/07/2014-us-average-soybean-yield.html
on 2016-05-16

[bushel1]
https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/scales/bushels.html on 2016-05-16

Yield might be 50 bushels per acre [soybean1] but exceptionally,
100. 3000 lbs per acre [bushel1].

3360 kg per hectare.
3m² per kg.

How much milk does that make?

Alpro Soya Milk seems to be 6.5% soya bean.

So 0.5 litres of milk a day is about 200 litres of milk a year.
Which is (× 0.065) 13 kg bean per year.

So, if we drink soy milk, we need about 40m², or 2 square rods
(one fifth of an allotment).

# Eggs

Why did the frenchman have only one egg for breakfast?

Because one egg is un oeuf.

According to wikipedia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs#European_Union]
EU regs require that a free range hen has 4m² space.
That hen will, if replaced on a regular basis,
produce one egg per day.

So for our frenchman's daily egg consumption we require only 4m².

Except that we forgot to feed the hen.
100g per day
http://www.poultryhub.org/nutrition/nutrient-requirements/nutrient-requirements-of-egg-laying-chickens/
36.5 kg per year.

Assuming we feed them soybean,
that's about 110m² of land to
grow the soybean to feed to the chickens.

Whatever the numbers it's clear that feeding the hens takes far
more land than accommodating them.

About ½ allotment.

Of course, given half an allotment of land growing a crop, one
coule simply keep the hen on that.
You can't really save much land this way,
because that land still has to be capable of
growing enough food to feed the hen.
It doesn't matter whether you harvest and process the food first,
or whether the hen eats it directly off the land.

# Oats

[oat1] Product description for "Oatly Healthy Organic Oat Drink 1L"

[crop0815] http://www.usda.gov/nass/PUBS/TODAYRPT/crop0815.pdf

Oat yield varies between 36 and 100 bushels per acre [crop0815].
A bushel of oats is 32 lb (according to wikipedia).
Which is between 1290 and 3590 kg per hectare.
Yields in Europe are much higher [eurostat].
Between 1200 (Portugal) and 8440 kg per hectare
(Republic of Ireland).
With several nation states cropping above 5000 kg per hectare.

The reference above nicely illustrates the relationship between
yield and area harvested.
The more land you put into production the lower the yield.
As you try and find more land to plant,
the land becomes harder to find and less suitable.
The amount of land that is truly excellent for
growing oats at high yield is very small.

Oat milk is about 10% oats [oat1].
0.5 litre per day is about 200 litre per year per person.
about 20 kg of oats (in the form of milk) per person per year.

Assuming a reasonably good, but not close to best,
yield of 4000 kg per hectare,
we have 2.5m² per kg.

So 50 m² of oats per person per year.
A fifth of an allotment.

# Oilseed Rape

(obviously going to decay)

(see also Plastic)

(aka Canola?)

2.5 millions tonnes in 1.6millions acres [nfu1]. 26 million

# Maize

_Zea mays_

[HC180] Soil Health, Environmental Audit Committee, 2016-05-25

Reported in paragraph 70 of [HC180]: 186000 hectares maize.
0.12 allotments each.

# Milk (Cow's Milk)

From Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle#Dairy
average output is 22 litres per cow per day.

(see also Soybean)

# Bamboo

A random webpage
http://madeinusachallenge.com/2012/help-grow-the-bamboo-industry-in-the-usa/
report that bamboo in a 3 year cycle yields 20 m tons (metric
tonnes?) per acre (ugh).
Which is

4.9 kg per m²
