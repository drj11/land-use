# An investigation of personal land use

How much land do we use in goods and services that we purchase,
consume, or are used on our behalf?

# Units

Consider adopting a friendly accessible unit.

Allotments are typically, since Anglo-Saxon times, 10 square
rods, which is very close to 250 m².

So you need, say, ⅛ of an allotment to grow your tea.

(thanks to Mike Smith for this idea)

Awesome fact: Land Area of UK is 1 billion allotments.
About 15 each.
